## Introduction

Instructional design is a systematic process used to create educational experiences and materials that effectively facilitate learning and improve student outcomes. It involves analyzing learners' needs, defining clear objectives, structuring content, and selecting appropriate teaching methods and resources to achieve those objectives. Unlike a syllabus, which outlines the topics and schedule of a course, instructional design focuses on the pedagogical approach, instructional strategies, and assessment methods to ensure that the content is delivered in a way that maximizes learning. 
::::

While the syllabus provides a roadmap of what will be taught, instructional design details the "how" and "why" of teaching each component, aiming to create a coherent and engaging learning experience. This process ensures that the course not only covers the necessary material but also aligns with educational goals and effectively supports students in achieving them. Then `What is Instructional Design?`. Watch the following video to get a clear understanding.

This course will introduce the basic components and functions of computer systems, including hardware, software, and programming environments. This foundational understanding will bridge the gap between theoretical algorithmic thinking and practical computational implementation, facilitating the effective application of algorithms in programming tasks.

### Familiarization of Computer System, Editors, Various Language Translators

Knowledge of computer architecture, including the roles of input/output devices, memory, and various types of software, enables programmers to write more efficient and effective code. This understanding helps in debugging, optimizing performance, and leveraging system resources effectively. By grasping how language translators like compilers, interpreters, and assemblers work, programmers can better appreciate how their code is transformed into executable instructions and troubleshoot issues with greater precision. 

:::{.callout-note}
### The poetry of programming

To showcase how the new generation views and engages with technology, we can draw inspiration from Linda Liukas' TEDx talk.

## Transition from Algorithmic Thinking to Programming

The algorithmic thinking process involves breaking down a problem into a series of logical steps, as illustrated by our flowcharts. This conceptual framework is very important for defining clear, sequential instructions to solve a problem. However, to bring these concepts into a practical domain, we need to translate them into a programming language that can execute these instructions.

## Transition from Algorithmic Thinking to Programming

Algorithmic thinking involves deconstructing problems into logical, sequential steps, as demonstrated by our flowcharts. Converting these concepts into a practical programming language allows us to execute these steps effectively. Historically, high-level programming languages like `C`, `C++`, and `Java` have been instrumental in translating algorithms into executable code. Here’s a comparison of these languages with `Python`, highlighting why `Python` is particularly suitable for computational thinking in engineering. Advantages of `Python` over other popular programming languages is explained in the following video.

## Historical Context and Comparison

### C Language
 Developed in the early 1970s, `C` is one of the earliest high-level programming languages. It provides a foundation for many modern languages and is known for its performance and low-level memory manipulation capabilities. `C` requires explicit management of memory and pointers, which adds complexity to code. While powerful, it lacks some of the high-level abstractions and simplicity found in `Python`.

### C++ Language

 An extension of `C`, `C++` was developed in the early 1980s and introduced object-oriented programming features. It allows for complex data modeling and high-performance applications. `C++` offers more control over system resources but at the cost of increased complexity. It involves managing object-oriented concepts and memory explicitly, which can be challenging for beginners.

### Java Language
Developed in the mid-1990s, `Java` is known for its portability across platforms, thanks to the `Java Virtual Machine` (JVM). It emphasizes object-oriented programming and has extensive libraries. `Java`'s syntax is more verbose compared to `Python`. It requires managing class structures and access modifiers, which can make code less straightforward to write and read.

## Why `Python` is Preferred for Computational Thinking?
`Python`, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, emerged from a desire to develop a language that was both easy to read and write, while also being powerful enough to handle complex tasks. It was inspired by the ABC language, which van Rossum had worked on during his time at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. `Python`'s base code was written in C, which provides a solid foundation for its extensive standard library and cross-platform capabilities. The language emphasizes readability and simplicity, featuring an elegant syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to many other languages. This design philosophy has contributed to `Python`'s widespread adoption across various fields, from web development to scientific computing and engineering.
Popular features of `Python` programming language are:

### 1. Readability and Simplicity
`Python`’s syntax is designed to be clear and intuitive, resembling natural language. This simplicity allows engineers to focus on the logic of their algorithms without being bogged down by complex syntax. For computational thinking, where clarity and understanding are crucial, `Python`’s readability reduces cognitive load, making it easier to implement and debug algorithms.

### 2. Versatility and Ease of Use
`Python` supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex systems. This adaptability is particularly useful in engineering, where problems often span different domains and require diverse approaches.

### 3. Rich Libraries and Frameworks
`Python`’s extensive standard library and third-party modules simplify many tasks. Libraries such as `NumPy` for numerical computations, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `Matplotlib` for visualization provide powerful tools for engineers. These libraries streamline the implementation of complex algorithms and data handling, making `Python` an efficient choice for solving engineering problems.

:::{.callout-tip}
### Verdict

The historical languages like `C`, `C++`, and `Java` have their strengths, `Python`'s readability, versatility, and extensive libraries make it particularly well-suited for computational thinking in engineering. By transitioning from conceptual algorithmic thinking to practical `Python` programming, engineers can effectively apply and implement their problem-solving strategies in a straightforward and efficient manner.

:::

Future sessions will delve into various `Python` examples, reinforcing the practical application of these concepts and preparing students for advanced problem-solving in their respective engineering fields.

### Just a second...

Programming extends beyond mere coding, which involves translating instructions into a form that computers can execute. While coding focuses on syntax and grammar, programming encompasses the entire process of solving problems, from understanding the problem and designing algorithms to implementing and testing solutions. This broader view highlights the importance of logical thinking, a skill central to effective programming. According to Lesli Lambort, "Programming is not just about writing code; it’s about creating solutions through a logical process." This involves breaking down complex problems, understanding their components, and systematically building solutions. Just watch what Labort saying on this topic.

## Python Fundamentals

### Python Programming Overview

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Over the years, Python has undergone significant development and improvement, with major releases adding new features and optimizations. The language's versatility and ease of use have made it popular in various domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more. Python's extensive standard library and active community contribute to its widespread adoption, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.


### Variables

In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.

**Basic Input/Output Functions**

Python provides built-in functions for basic input and output operations. The `print()` function is used to display output, while the `input()` function is used to take input from the user.

*Output with `print()` function*


::: {.panel-tabset}

## Template
```{.python}
# Printing text
print("Hello, World!")

# Printing multiple values
x = 5
y = 10
print("The value of x is:", x, "and the value of y is:", y)
```

## DIY

```{pyodide-python}
# Printing text
print("Hello, World!")

# Printing multiple values
x = 5
y = 10
print("The value of x is:", x, "and the value of y is:", y)
```
:::


>Example 2


::: {.panel-tabset}

## Template
```{.python}
# Assigning values to variables
a = 10
b = 20.5
name = "Alice"

# Printing the values
print("Values Stored in the Variables:")
print(a)
print(b)
print(name)
```

## DIY

```{pyodide-python}
# Assigning values to variables
a = 10
b = 20.5
name = "Alice"

# Printing the values
print("Values Stored in the Variables:")
print(a)
print(b)
print(name)
```
:::


*Input with `input()` Function:*

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Template
```{.python}
# Taking input from the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Taking numerical input
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```

## DIY

```{pyodide-python}
name="Joseph"
age=44
# Taking input from the user (uncomment the following line while executing interatively)
#name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Taking numerical input (uncomment the following line while executing interatively)
#age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```
:::

:::{.callout-note}
The `print()` function in Python, defined in the built-in `__builtin__` module, is used to display output on the screen, providing a simple way to output text and variable values to the console.
:::

**Combining Variables and Input/Output**

us can combine variables and input/output functions to create interactive programs.

>Example: Find sum of two numbers



::: {.panel-tabset}
## Template

```python
# Program to calculate the sum of two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
```
## DIY

```{pyodide-python}
# Program to calculate the sum of two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
```

:::

### Python Programming Style

#### Indentation

Python uses indentation to define the blocks of code. Proper indentation is crucial as it affects the program's flow. Use 4 spaces per indentation level. For example consider the `conditional` statement below to find the larger among two numbers $a$ and $b$. Here to encapsulate the `if` part, we just use an indendation of 4 white spaces, similar for the `else` part.

```python
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("b is greater than or equal to a")
```


#### Comments
Use comments to explain user code. Comments begin with the `#` symbol and extend to the end of the line. Write comments that are clear and concise. See the example:

```python
# This is a comment
a = 10  # This is an inline comment
```
Here the first line is just a comment. But in the second line, the comment is used to explain what that line of code do!

#### Variable Naming

Use meaningful variable names to make the code more understandable. Variable names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores. Two examples are given below.

```python
student_name = "John"
total_score = 95
```

#### Consistent Style

Follow the `PEP 8` style guide for Python code to maintain consistency and readability. Use blank lines to separate different sections of usr code. See the following example of function definition:

```python

def calculate_sum(x, y):
    return x + y

result = calculate_sum(5, 3)
print(result)
```

## Basic Datatypes in Python

In Python, a datatype is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Understanding datatypes is essential as it helps in performing appropriate operations on variables. Python supports various built-in datatypes, which can be categorized into several groups.

### Numeric Types

Numeric types represent data that consists of numbers. Python has three distinct numeric types:

1. **Integers (`int`)**:
   - Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
   - Example: `a = 10`, `b = -5`.

2. **Floating Point Numbers (`float`)**:
   - Numbers that contain a decimal point.
   - Example: `pi = 3.14`, `temperature = -7.5`.

3. **Complex Numbers (`complex`)**:
   - Numbers with a real and an imaginary part.
   - Example: `z = 3 + 4j`.

```python
# Examples of numeric types
a = 10         # Integer
pi = 3.14      # Float
z = 3 + 4j     # Complex
```
:::{.callout-note}
### How to find datatype of a variable?

To get the type of a variable in `Python`, you can use the built-in `type()` function.

The basic syntax looks like this:

```{.python}
type(variable_name)
```
We can try this function in the above example as follows.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Template

```python
# Examples of numeric types
a = 10         # Integer
pi = 3.14      # Float
z = 3 + 4j     # Complex
# extract datatype

type(a)
type(pi)
type(z)
```
## DIY

```{pyodide-python}
# Examples of numeric types
a = 10         # Integer
pi = 3.14      # Float
z = 3 + 4j     # Complex
# extract datatype

print("Datatype of a is:",type(a))
print("Datatype of pi is:",type(pi))
print("Datatype of z is:",type(z))
```

:::

### Sequence Types

Sequence types are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Python has several sequence types, including:

#### String Type

Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They are used to handle and manipulate textual data.

**Characteristics of Strings**

- *Ordered*: Characters in a string have a defined order.
- *Immutable*: Strings cannot be modified after they are created.
- *Heterogeneous*: Strings can include any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

**Creating Strings**

Strings can be created using single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes for multiline strings.

>Example:

```python
# Creating strings with different types of quotes
single_quoted = 'Hello, World!'
double_quoted = "Hello, World!"
multiline_string = """This is a
multiline string"""
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::


**Accessing String Characters**

Characters in a string are accessed using their index, with the first character having an index of 0. Negative indexing can be used to access characters from the end.

>Example:

```python
# Accessing characters in a string
first_char = single_quoted[0]  # Output: 'H'
last_char = single_quoted[-1]  # Output: '!'
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Common String Methods**

Python provides various methods for string manipulation:

1. `upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.
2. `lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.
3. `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
4. `replace(old, new)`: Replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring.
5. `split(separator)`: Splits the string into a list based on a separator.

>Example:

```python
# Using string methods
text = "   hello, world!   "
uppercase_text = text.upper()       # Result: "   HELLO, WORLD!   "
stripped_text = text.strip()        # Result: "hello, world!"
replaced_text = text.replace("world", "Python")  # Result: "   hello, Python!   "
words = text.split(",")             # Result: ['hello', ' world!   ']
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

#### List Type

Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used sequence types in Python. They allow for the storage and manipulation of ordered collections of items.

>**Characteristics of Lists**

- *Ordered*: The items in a list have a defined order, which will not change unless explicitly modified.
- *Mutable*: The content of a list can be changed after its creation (i.e., items can be added, removed, or modified).
- *Dynamic*: Lists can grow or shrink in size as items are added or removed.
- *Heterogeneous*: Items in a list can be of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats).

**Creating Lists**

Lists are created by placing comma-separated values inside square brackets.

>Example:

```python
# Creating a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Creating a mixed list
mixed_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14]
``` 
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Accessing List Items**

List items are accessed using their index, with the first item having an index of 0.

>Example:

```python

# Accessing the first item
first_fruit = fruits[0]  # Output: "apple"

# Accessing the last item
last_fruit = fruits[-1]  # Output: "cherry"
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Modifying Lists**

Lists can be modified by changing the value of specific items, adding new items, or removing existing items.

>Example:

```python
# Changing the value of an item
fruits[1] = "blueberry"  # fruits is now ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry"]

# Adding a new item
fruits.append("orange")  # fruits is now ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry", "orange"]

# Removing an item
fruits.remove("blueberry")  # fruits is now ["apple", "cherry", "orange"]
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**List Methods**

`Python` provides several built-in methods to work with lists:

1. `append(item)`: Adds an item to the end of the list.
2. `insert(index, item)`: Inserts an item at a specified index.
3. `remove(item)`: Removes the first occurrence of an item.
4. `pop(index)`: Removes and returns the item at the specified index.
5. `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
6. `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the list.

>Example:

```python
# Using list methods
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1]

numbers.append(4)     # numbers is now [5, 2, 9, 1, 4]
numbers.sort()        # numbers is now [1, 2, 4, 5, 9]
numbers.reverse()     # numbers is now [9, 5, 4, 2, 1]
first_number = numbers.pop(0)  # first_number is 9, numbers is now [5, 4, 2, 1]
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

#### Tuple Type

Tuples are a built-in sequence type in Python that is used to store an ordered collection of items. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, which means their contents cannot be changed after creation.

**Characteristics of Tuples**

- *Ordered*: Tuples maintain the order of items, which is consistent throughout their lifetime.
- *Immutable*: Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. This includes adding, removing, or changing items.
- *Fixed Size*: The size of a tuple is fixed; it cannot grow or shrink after creation.
- *Heterogeneous*: Tuples can contain items of different data types, such as integers, strings, and floats.

**Creating Tuples**

Tuples are created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses. Single-element tuples require a trailing comma.

>Example:

```python
# Creating a tuple with multiple items
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)

# Creating a single-element tuple
single_element_tuple = (5,)

# Creating a tuple with mixed data types
mixed_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14)
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Accessing Tuple Items**

Tuple items are accessed using their index, with the first item having an index of 0. Negative indexing can be used to access items from the end.

>Example:

```python
# Accessing the first item
x = coordinates[0]  # Output: 10

# Accessing the last item
z = coordinates[-1]  # Output: 30
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Modifying Tuples**

Since tuples are immutable, their contents cannot be modified. However, us can create new tuples by combining or slicing existing ones.

>Example:

```python
# Combining tuples
new_coordinates = coordinates + (40, 50)  # Result: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Slicing tuples
sub_tuple = coordinates[1:3]  # Result: (20, 30)

```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::


**Tuple Methods**

Tuples have a limited set of built-in methods compared to lists:

1. `count(item)`: Returns the number of occurrences of the specified item.
2. `index(item)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item.

>Example:

```python
# Using tuple methods
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1)

# Counting occurrences of an item
count_1 = numbers.count(1)  # Result: 3

# Finding the index of an item
index_2 = numbers.index(2)  # Result: 1
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

### Mapping Types

Mapping types in Python are used to store data in key-value pairs. Unlike sequences, mappings do not maintain an order and are designed for quick lookups of data.

#### Dictionary (`dict`)

The primary mapping type in Python is the `dict`. Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, where each key must be unique, and keys are used to access their corresponding values.

**Characteristics of Dictionaries**

- *Unordered*: The order of items is not guaranteed and may vary.
- *Mutable*: us can add, remove, and change items after creation.
- *Keys*: Must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
- *Values*: Can be of any data type and can be duplicated.

**Creating Dictionaries**

Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`.

>Example:

```python
# Creating a dictionary
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 21,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Accessing and Modifying Dictionary Items**

Items in a dictionary are accessed using their keys. us can also modify, add, or remove items.

>Example:

```python
# Accessing a value
name = student["name"]  # Output: "Alice"

# Modifying a value
student["age"] = 22  # Updates the age to 22

# Adding a new key-value pair
student["graduation_year"] = 2024

# Removing a key-value pair
del student["major"]
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::


**Dictionary Methods**

Python provides several built-in methods to work with dictionaries:

1. `keys()`: Returns a view object of all keys.
2. `values()`: Returns a view object of all values.
3. `items()`: Returns a view object of all key-value pairs.
4. `get(key, default)`: Returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found.
5. `pop(key, default)`: Removes and returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found.

>Example:

```python
# Using dictionary methods
keys = student.keys()        # Result: dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'graduation_year'])
values = student.values()    # Result: dict_values(['Alice', 22, 2024])
items = student.items()      # Result: dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 22), ('graduation_year', 2024)])
name = student.get("name")  # Result: "Alice"
age = student.pop("age")    # Result: 22
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::


### Set Types

Sets are a built-in data type in Python used to store unique, unordered collections of items. They are particularly useful for operations involving membership tests, set operations, and removing duplicates.

**Characteristics of Sets**

- *Unordered* : The items in a set do not have a specific order and may change.
- *Mutable* : us can add or remove items from a set after its creation.
- *Unique* : Sets do not allow duplicate items; all items must be unique.
- *Unindexed* : Sets do not support indexing or slicing.

**Creating Sets**

Sets are created using curly braces `{}` with comma-separated values, or using the `set()` function.

>Example:

```python
# Creating a set using curly braces
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# Creating a set using the set() function
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Accessing and Modifying Set Items**

While us cannot access individual items by index, us can check for membership and perform operations like adding or removing items.

>Example:

```python
# Checking membership
has_apple = "apple" in fruits  # Output: True

# Adding an item
fruits.add("orange")

# Removing an item
fruits.remove("banana")  # Raises KeyError if item is not present
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Set Operations**
Sets support various mathematical set operations, such as `union`, `intersection`, and `difference`.

>Example:

```python
# Union of two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union = set1 | set2  # Result: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Intersection of two sets
intersection = set1 & set2  # Result: {3}

# Difference between two sets
difference = set1 - set2  # Result: {1, 2}

# Symmetric difference (items in either set, but not in both)
symmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2  # Result: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::


**Set Methods**

Python provides several built-in methods for set operations:

1. `add(item)`: Adds an item to the set.
2. `remove(item)`: Removes an item from the set; raises KeyError if item is not present.
3. `discard(item)`: Removes an item from the set if present; does not raise an error if item is not found.
4. `pop()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary item from the set.
5. `clear()`: Removes all items from the set.

>Example:

```python
# Using set methods
set1 = {1, 2, 3}

set1.add(4)        # set1 is now {1, 2, 3, 4}
set1.remove(2)     # set1 is now {1, 3, 4}
set1.discard(5)    # No error, set1 remains {1, 3, 4}
item = set1.pop()  # Removes and returns an arbitrary item, e.g., 1
set1.clear()      # set1 is now an empty set {}
```
::: {.panel-tabset}

#### ## Frozen Sets

Frozen sets are a built-in data type in Python that are similar to sets but are immutable. Once created, a frozen set cannot be modified, making it suitable for use as a key in dictionaries or as elements of other sets.

**Characteristics of Frozen Sets**

- *Unordered* : The items in a frozen set do not have a specific order and may change.
- *Immutable* : Unlike regular sets, frozen sets cannot be altered after creation. No items can be added or removed.
- *Unique* : Like sets, frozen sets do not allow duplicate items; all items must be unique.
- *Unindexed* : Frozen sets do not support indexing or slicing.

**Creating Frozen Sets**

Frozen sets are created using the `frozenset()` function, which takes an iterable as an argument.

>Example:

```python
# Creating a frozen set
numbers = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Creating a frozen set from a set
fruits = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

**Accessing and Modifying Frozen Set Items**

Frozen sets do not support modification operations such as adding or removing items. However, us can perform membership tests and other set operations.

>Example:

```python
# Checking membership
has_apple = "apple" in fruits  # Output: True

# Since frozenset is immutable, us cannot use add() or remove() methods
```

## Python Code

**Set Operations with Frozen Sets**

Frozen sets support various mathematical set operations similar to regular sets, such as union, intersection, and difference. These operations return new frozen sets and do not modify the original ones.

>Example:

```python
# Union of two frozen sets
set1 = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
set2 = frozenset([3, 4, 5])
union = set1 | set2  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

# Intersection of two frozen sets
intersection = set1 & set2  # Result: frozenset({3})

# Difference between two frozen sets
difference = set1 - set2  # Result: frozenset({1, 2})

# Symmetric difference (items in either set, but not in both)
symmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 4, 5})
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output

**Frozen Set Methods**

Frozen sets have a subset of the methods available to regular sets. The available methods include:

1. `copy()` : Returns a shallow copy of the frozen set.
2. `difference(other)` : Returns a new frozen set with elements in the original frozen set but not in other.
3. `intersection(other)` : Returns a new frozen set with elements common to both frozen sets.
4. `union(other)` : Returns a new frozen set with elements from both frozen sets.
5. `symmetric_difference(other)` : Returns a new frozen set with elements in either frozen set but not in both.

>Example:

```python
# Using frozen set methods
set1 = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
set2 = frozenset([3, 4, 5])

# Getting the difference
difference = set1.difference(set2)  # Result: frozenset({1, 2})

# Getting the intersection
intersection = set1.intersection(set2)  # Result: frozenset({3})

# Getting the union
union = set1.union(set2)  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

# Getting the symmetric difference
symmetric_difference = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 4, 5})

## Control Structures in Python

Control structures in Python allow us to control the flow of execution in our programs. They help manage decision-making, looping, and the execution of code blocks based on certain conditions. Python provides several key control structures: `if` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and control flow statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statement in Python is the `if` statement, which can be combined with `elif` and `else` to handle multiple conditions.

>Syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code block to execute if another_condition is True
else:
    # Code block to execute if none of the above conditions are True
```

>Example: Program to classify a person based on his/her age.

```python
age = 20

if age < 18:
    print("us are a minor.")
elif age < 65:
    print("us are an adult.")
else:
    print("us are a senior citizen.")
```

### Looping Statements
Looping statements are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports for loops and while loops.

#### For Loop
The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

>Syntax:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code block to execute for each item

```

>Example: Program to print names of fruits saved in a list.

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

#### While Loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.

>Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # Code block to execute while condition is True

```

>Example: Print all counting numbers less than 5.

```python
# Counting from 0 to 4
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

### Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements alter the flow of execution within loops and conditionals.

#### Break Statement

The `break` statement exits the current loop, regardless of the loop's condition.

>Example: Program to exit from the printing of whole numbers less than 10, while trigger 5.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::


#### Continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.

>Example: Program to print all the whole numbers in the range 5 except 2.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i) 
# Output: 0 1 3 4
```
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Code

## Output


:::

#### Pass Statement

The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing and is used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.

>Example: Program to print all the whole numbers in the range 5 except 3.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    else:
        print(i)
# Output: 0 1 2 4
```

## Cautions When Using Control Flow Structures
Control flow structures are essential in Python programming for directing the flow of execution. However, improper use of these structures can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and unintended behaviors. Here are some cautions to keep in mind:

**Infinite Loops**

- **Issue**: A `while` loop with a condition that never becomes `False` can lead to an infinite loop, which will cause the program to hang or become unresponsive.
- **Caution**: Always ensure that the condition in a `while` loop will eventually become `False`, and include logic within the loop to modify the condition.

**Example:**

```python
# Infinite loop example
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    # Missing count increment, causing an infinite loop
```

## Functions in Python Programming

Functions are a fundamental concept in Python programming that enable code reuse, modularity, and organization. They allow us to encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task, which can be executed whenever needed. Functions are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code, making them a cornerstone of effective programming practices.

**What is a Function?**

A function is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can take inputs, called parameters or arguments, and can return outputs, which are the results of the computation or task performed by the function. By defining functions, we can write code once and reuse it multiple times, which enhances both efficiency and readability.

**Defining a Function**

In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses containing any parameters, and a colon. The function body, which contains the code to be executed, is indented below the function definition.

>Syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Code block
    return result
```
>Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    Returns a greeting message for the given name.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

#### Relevance of functions in Programming
1. *Code Reusability* : Functions allow us to define a piece of code once and reuse it in multiple places. This reduces redundancy and helps maintain consistency across our codebase.

2. *Modularity* : Functions break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Each function can be focused on a specific task, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.

3. *Abstraction* : Functions enable us to abstract away the implementation details. We can use a function without needing to know its internal workings, which simplifies the code we write and enhances readability.

4. *Testing and Debugging* : Functions allow us to test individual components of our code separately. This isolation helps in identifying and fixing bugs more efficiently.

5. *Library Creation* : Functions are the building blocks of libraries and modules. By organizing related functions into libraries, we can create reusable components that can be shared and utilized across different projects.

>Example: Creating a Simple Library

**Stage 1:** Define Functions in a Module

```python
# my_library.py

def add(a, b):
    """
    Returns the sum of two numbers.
    """
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Returns the product of two numbers.
    """
    return a * b
```
**Stage 2:**  Use the Library in Another Program

```python
# main.py

import my_library

result_sum = my_library.add(5, 3)
result_product = my_library.multiply(5, 3)

print(f"Sum: {result_sum}")
print(f"Product: {result_product}")
```
