This site contains information about a FDP organised in Saintgits College of Engineering (Autonomous) to disseminate the instructional design of the foundational course "Python Programming."  The FDP will guide educators through the courseâ€™s structure, emphasizing the integration of Python programming as a tool for implementing algorithmic concepts. Participants will gain hands-on experience with key tools such as GitHub, Python, Quarto, and Raptor, which are essential for both teaching and applying these concepts effectively.
